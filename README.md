# Malwares
Hello guys, this malware repository is still under development.
Now it is not perfect yet but i still can add more if anyone requested :)



You must use a virtual machine to test these.
Lets face it, malware is not a good thing, just to be safe, use a virtual machine ðŸ˜ƒ
And then, some malwares that are there aren't reviewed on my channel, why?
I can't just review all of them, just a little tiring!
That is all for the repository, I'm going to add more as I download.

Note, one of the malware is bigger than 25mb which I can't upload, so this malware is not available :(
So, you may be asking, how do I download these malware samples?
Easy! I use malshare to download some of these, some on youtube videos, some on any.run
Any Issues? Just tell me at issues tab in my repository.
And mostly, I am finding more samples in the future.


Some of you know this popular malware called emotet right?

Well because now office has protected mode, it prevents it from running and older versions of office is vunerable.
So watch out of suspicious/malicious emails, because they can ruin your computer up.


Support is appreciated if you want to do something with the repository, just fork it so that it will clone the repository and you can do
something!
