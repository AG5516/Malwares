Hello guys, this malware repository is still under development.
Now it is not perfect yet but i still can add more if anyone requested :)

You must use a virtual machine to test these.
Lets face it, malware is not a good thing, just to be safe, use a virtual machine ðŸ˜ƒ
And then, some malwares that are there aren't reviewed on my channel, why?
I can't just review all of them, just a little tiring!
That is all for the repository, I'm going to add more as I download.
